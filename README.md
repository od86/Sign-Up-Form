# Sign-Up-Form
This is a website that is supposed to look like a sign up form.

## TOP
This is for the Sign-Up Form lesson on the Odin Project - https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form

## Creation
This is written in purely HTML and CSS it has no actually functionality and all the validation is just built in features that HTML provides.
I based this around the game Titanfall 2.
